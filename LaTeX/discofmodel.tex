\section{Discussion of model}
\subsection{The impatience term}
 Here we can see why this term is 
called the impatience of the agent. If the fraction between the average speed 
in the desired direction and the initial speed is low the impatience term will 
be close to one. When the impatience term is close to one $V_{\alpha}^{0} 
\left( t \right)$ is dominated by $V_{\alpha}^{\text{max}}$. That is, if the 
agent have not moved very far in the desired direction compared to the initial 
speed the impatience of the agent will be close to one. This in term will 
cause the agent's future velocity to be dominated by the maximum velocity of 
the agent.
