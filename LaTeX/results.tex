These are the kinds of graphs we are going to make from the simulation. These 
does not represent what we will actually have in the report, since there is 
still calibration etc. to be done. We haven't started doing analysis of them 
yet either. They are just put here to give an idea of what it is we will be 
getting from all of this.
