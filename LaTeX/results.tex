\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section we describe the results obtained from our simulations.  The 
section is divided into two parts. In the first part we present some general 
results of our simulations, reviewing the general behaviour of our 
simulations. In the second part we present the results of our attempts to 
replicate the phenomena outlined in section~\ref{sec:article-results}. A 
discussion of these results is presented in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsection{The basics}
In this section we describe some general results of our simulations and the 
behaviour of our model. First we present the scenarios that we have simulated, 
and the parameters used in the simulations. We then move on to comment on the 
general behaviour of the pedestrians in our simulations and within which 
limits the simulations give reasonable results.

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
As outlined in section~\ref{sec:scenario-presentation}, we will simulate two 
different main scenarios, a square room and a corridor, with some variations 
of the latter. Counting these variations, we simulate four different 
scenarios: A rectangle shaped room with a door in the middle of one of the 
walls, and a normal corridor, a corridor with a bottleneck in the middle and a 
corridor with a sudden open space. In the corridors we do simulations of both 
uni-- and birectional flow. Images of each of these scenarios are presented in 
figure \ref{fig:fourcases}.

\subsubsection{Parameters}
As explained in section~\ref{sec:varying-constants}, we start out with the 
model parameters outlined in section~\ref{sec:init-cond} and vary them when 
necessary to get useful results from the simulations.  The values we use 
initially are summarised in table \ref{tbl:parameter-settings}. Whenever a 
parameter is changed from these values, we will point it out and explain why 
the change has been necessary.

        \label{tbl:parameter-settings}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{General behaviour of the model}
Our simulations have shown that it is indeed possible to create simulations 
that upon visual inspection show reasonable behaviour of the pedestrians. That 
is, pedestrians move through the scenarios without passing through walls or 
each other, and we see clogging of exits as we expected. However, the 
behaviour is very much dependent on the parameter values. This means that if, 
for example, the mean initial desired velocity for the pedestrians is 
increased, pedestrians will start walking through each other and the walls.  
This can be remedied by also increasing the parameters controlling the 
magnitude of the repulsive forces, which indicates that there is some 
interdependence of the parameters. We have not done a detailed analysis of 
this, though.

For examples of simulations we've made films available along with the source 
code for the simulations\footnote{See 
\url{http://akira.ruc.dk/~tohojo/crowd-modelling}.}.

\subsection{The results from the literature}\label{subsec:ThePhenomena}
In this section we present the results we obtained from our attempts
to replicate the results from the literature outlined in 
section~\ref{sec:article-results}.  For each of the results we will go into a 
bit more detail on the phenomenon we seek to replicate, and then present how 
well our results match the expected. The results we replicate are presented in 
detail in several different articles, but according to \cite{self-org}, they 
should all be possible to see using the model we are simulating.

\subsubsection{The faster-is-slower effect}
As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:article-results}, the faster-is-slower effect 
is seen when pedestrians leave a room. The effect is that faster desired 
movement speeds yield a longer time to empty the room, contrary to what might 
be expected. The results from \cite{helbing00} where this effect is described 
can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:LtNFasterIsSlower}. Here it is apparent that 
clogging occurs at the doorway (figure~\ref{subfig:fast-slow-clogging}), 
leading to a longer time to clear the room for desired velocities above 
$1,5m/s$ (figure~\ref{subfig:fast-slow-graph}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \subfloat[Clogging at the exit.]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/square_room_letters.png}
        \label{subfig:fast-slow-clogging}
    }
    \subfloat[Leaving time versus desired velocity.]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/leaving_time.png}

    }
    \caption[Faster-is-slower effect from \cite{helbing00}]{Faster-is-slower

    occurs at doorways. \subref{subfig:fast-slow-graph} Fast desired 
    velocities leads to slower emptying of the room.}
    \label{fig:LtNFasterIsSlower}
\end{figure}

In our simulations of the square room scenario we have clogging in the 
doorways as expected (see figure~\ref{subfig:image-square-room}). We have 
plotted the time to leave the room as a function of the initial desired 
velocity with values from $0,5$ to $5,0$. As can be seen in 
figure~\ref{fig:square-room-leaving}, we do not see the increasing leaving 
time, although it is not a linear relationship between the velocity and 
leaving time either. Looking at the results, we conclude that we  do not see 
the faster-is-slower effect.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/fastIsSlowNot.pdf}
    \caption[Leaving time for the square room]{Leaving time for the square 
    room. While there is not a linear relation between velocity and leaving 
    time, we do not see the increase in leaving time we expected.}
    \label{fig:square-room-leaving}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Freezing by heating effect}
The freezing by heating effect occurs when pedestrians are moving in opposite 
directions and they block each other when the velocity increases (see 
section~\ref{sec:article-results}). The illustration of this effect as 
presented in \cite{oscil} can be seen in 
figure~\ref{fig:freezing_by_heating_litterature}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \subfloat[]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/heatfreeze.png}}
    \caption[Freezing by heating effect from \cite{oscil}]{Freezing by heating 
    effect from \cite{oscil}. Pedestrians block each other as a result of the 
    freezing by heating.}
    \label{fig:freezing_by_heating_litterature}
\end{figure}

During our simulations we have not been able to reproduce this effect at all.  
Although we have seen clogging of corridors, it only occurs at low velocities, 
and so does not increase with the velocity as we expected. Instead, when 
pedestrians move faster, they are more likely to be able to pass each other 
even in corridors with high densities. So like the faster is slower
effect again we see no sign of a high desired velocity decreasing/stopping
the movement of the pedestrians.

\subsubsection{Lane formation}
Lane formation happens when the simulation contains bidirectional flow in 
corridors. As stated in \ref{self-org}:

\begin{quote}
    If pedestrians crowds moving in opposite directions meet each other, they 
    form small \emph{channels} in the beginning, but these channels later 
    merge to produce wide lanes
\end{quote}

An illustration of this phenomenon from \cite{lanes} can be seen in 
figure~\ref{fig:lanes-literature}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/flow_lanes_litterature.png}
    \caption[Lane formation from \cite{lanes}]{Lane formation from 
    \cite{lanes}. Pedestrians through a corridor form alternating lanes of 
    pedestrians going in each direction.}
    \label{fig:lanes-literature}
\end{figure}

Since we have three different corridor cases we have looked for lane
formation in all of them. As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:laneformation}, 
the lane formation occurs in all of the cases.

    corridor simulations. The colours indicate the direction the pedestrians 
    are moving in. Lane formation can be seen in all three cases.}
    \label{fig:laneformation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Oscillatory flow}
The oscillatory flow is expected to arise in the case of bidirectional
flow through a bottleneck. The results are presented in figure
\ref{fig:oscillitoryflow}.\\

When looking at the simulation while it is running it is not
immediately clear that the oscillatory flow occurs. Clogging
appears in both ends of the bottleneck and people are sometimes
squeezed through the bottleneck. The graph presented in
\ref{fig:oscillitoryflow} does indicate that the oscillatory
flow occurs.

In the article \cite{oscil}, they show a figure of the oscillatory flow. They 
don't show any graph of the flow in different directions or anything like 
that, but basicly just shows a screen shot giving some idea about the 
phenomena along with a discribtion of the phenomena. They describe it as the 
pressure building up from one side and the at some point a small group of 
pedestrians slip through. When that happens the pressure on the other side 
builds up and then at some time some pedestrians from that side slips through 
and so on. Figure \ref{fig:oscillitoryflow_litterature} shows the 
presentations of the oscillatory flow from \cite{oscil}. This describtions 
fits with what we ourself experince through simulations of the model too.

    black pedestrians that already have slip through and now the white 
    pedestrians going in the other direction a passing through the 
    bottleneck.}
    \label{fig:oscillitoryflow_litterature}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Summery}
We have been able to get a working simulation of the social force model 
presented in \cite{self-org} with components taken from \cite{ABconstant}. 
The most basic dynamics og the simulations seems to be running like as it 
should and our simulations show lane formation in bidirectional flow. We also  
see oscillatory flow at bottlenecks however freezin-by-heating 
and faster-is-slower effect is not observed at all.
