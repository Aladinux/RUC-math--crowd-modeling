\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\subsection{Further work}
Since the simulation we present in the report did't reproduce all the phenomena described in \ref{sec:resultsObtainedFromModels}, if given more time our group would like to solve the discrepancies and add the possible solutions that has been talked about in section~\ref{sec:discussion}. The first thing to do maybe modify the repulsive
forces and add the frictional force, and make them velocity dependent, which
will make the crowd behave more realistic. To enable the model to simulate
more complex situation, we will need the path finding feature. Also a set of
parameters should be determined when the environment is changed, and the
method to attain those parameters may be the same as what the Helbing group
has been doing, that is by doing some experiments and analyzing the video
track.

Making predictions and evaluating actual designs around the country such ass malls, theaters etc.. and coming up with improvements.

It would be interesting to examen how large an error occur due to the euler approximation and if this error is of any significants. If sow would some other method of approximation give any quantities improvements.
