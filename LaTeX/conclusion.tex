\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\subsection{Further work}
Since the simulation we present in the report has not shown some properties of 
a crowd, if given more time our group would like try to solve the 
discrepancies and add the possible solutions that has been talked about in 
section \ref{sec:discussion}. The first thing to do maybe modify the repulsive 
forces and add the frictional force, and make them velocity dependent, which 
will make the crowd behave more realistic.  To enable the model to simulate 
more complex situation, we will need the path finding feature. Also a set of 
parameters should be determined when the environment is changed, and the 
method to attain those parameters may be the same as what the Helbing group 
has been doing, that is by doing some experiments and analysing the video 
track.
